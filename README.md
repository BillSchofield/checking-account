# Intro

This project is intended to be used as part of a workshop which provides opportunities for you to:

* Develop your skills with our core practices:
    * Pair Programming
    * Test Driven Development
* Build muscle memory with some of our more commonly used tools, language features, and frameworks.

# Workshop

## Structure

We will work on project [user stories](User-Stories.md) in ~1-hour cycles
composed of:

* (40 minutes) Pairing on stories -or- Facilitated discussion around one of the learning objections
* (10 minute) Mob code review where the group discusses code changes made by one of the pairs.
* (10 minute) Break. You're expected to actually take a break away from your computer (and other screen).

## Practices

We will prioritize learning and quality outcomes by diligently following these practices:

* Pair programming. We'll rotate pairs first thing every morning.
* Test Driven Development
* Version control. Commit at least once per hour and push at least twice per day.
* Intentional refactoring

## Exercises

### Unit Testing

#### Structure of a unit test

#### Assertions

#### London-school and Detroit School unit testing

#### Sensing and Separation: Michael Feathers: Working Effectively with Legacy Code

    We break dependencies so we can write unit tests.  
    We break dependencies with 2 proximate goals:  
        SENSING: Provide access to values produced by a computation inside a class or method where we couldnâ€™t observe them for testing.  
        SEPARATION: Make a test target independent enough that we can actually stand it up in a test harness.  

#### Test doubles

### Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

#### Objects & Classes

#### Encapsulation
