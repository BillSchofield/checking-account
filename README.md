# Intro

This project is intended to be used as part of a workshop which provides opportunities for you to:

* Practice Pair Programming
* Practice TDD with a focus on the refactoring step
* Practice domain modeling
* Learn about Java language features like Exceptions and Collections
* Learn about common design patterns

# Workshop
## Format
### Structure
You will work on project [user stories](User-Stories.md) in ~1-hour cycles
composed of:

* (40 minutes) Pairing on stories -or- Facilitated discussion around one of the learning objections
* (10 minute) Mob code review where the group discusses code changes made by one of the pairs.
* (10 minute) Break. You're expected to actually take a break away from your computer (and other screen).

### Practices
We will be diligently using these practices and prioritize 
* Pair programming. We'll rotate pairs first thing in the morning and again in the afternoon.
* Test Driven Development
* Version control. Commit at least once per hour and push at least twice per day.
