# Intro

This project is intended to be used as part of a workshop which provides opportunities for you to:
* Develop your skills with our core practices:
  * Pair Programming
  * Test Driven Development
* Build muscle memory with some of our more commonly used tools, language features, and frameworks.

# Workshop
## Structure
We will work on project [user stories](User-Stories.md) in ~1-hour cycles
composed of:

* (40 minutes) Pairing on stories -or- Facilitated discussion around one of the learning objections
* (10 minute) Mob code review where the group discusses code changes made by one of the pairs.
* (10 minute) Break. You're expected to actually take a break away from your computer (and other screen).

## Practices
We will prioritize learning and quality outcomes by diligently following these practices: 
* Pair programming. We'll rotate pairs first thing every morning.
* Test Driven Development
* Version control. Commit at least once per hour and push at least twice per day.
* Intentional refactoring
